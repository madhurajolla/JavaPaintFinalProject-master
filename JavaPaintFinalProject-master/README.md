# JavaPaintFinalProject
 SE 450 JPaint Project
 
I have implemented application as part of my course SE 450 Object-Oriented Software Development.

**Sprint 1**

I have implemented default rectangle shape with Red color, with Undo and Redo functions.

Below is my Repo Link:
https://github.com/Cjonnala/JavaPaintFinalProject

**Sprint 2**

For this sprint I have implemented various colors, shading types and all three shpaes (Rectangle, Ellipse,Triangle). I have also implemented Select and Move operations.

**Sprint 3**

For this sprint I have implemented dashed outline for the shapes when they are selected. I have also implemented Copy, Paste and Delete Commands.

**Sprint 4**

For this sprint I have implemented "Group and Ungroup". I have also implemented Copy, Paste and Delete Commands.

**Design Pattern**

Implemented below design patterns in my project

1. Command Pattern
2. Factory Method Pattern
3. Strategy Pattern
4. Decorator Pattern
5. Composite Pattern

**Limitations**

1. Multiple paste is not working when any shape is selected 

**Bugs**
1.If we do undo multiple time the shape is going out of the paint canvas.

**<h1>Extra Credits</h1>**

1. Semi Circle
2. Pentagon
3. Rhombus
4. Droplet
5. Septagon
6. Octagon
7. Trapezoid
8. Square

<h3>Implemented additional feature - Tutorial/Help</h3>

- In general any application will have tab or option called "Tutorial/Help"
- This gives the information w.r.t tool, It's features and also on how to use them

<h4>Functionality</h4>

- When clicked on "Tutorial" button it will open a new window and display the required content
- The content is read from HTML document

**Note : This functionality can be extended to load the content from a webpage**

**<h2>Challenges</h2>**

1. Faced major challenge in implementing multiple design patterns
2. Implementing the paste functionality was also tricky, when the shapes  are being pasted, subsequently list also should get updated
3. Group and Ungroup was also tricky to implement, it was difficult to update new dimensions of the group o that it will work as a single unit
